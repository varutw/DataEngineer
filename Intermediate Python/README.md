# Intermediate Python

In this directory, it contains the notebook files that I summarised from 
[Intermediate Python Programming Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGOBQPFzWKo) 
from freeCodeCampe.org in the Youtube.

It includes some basic consepts, but emphasis on some lesser known capabilities, 
such as as asterisk operator, function arguments, or generator.
